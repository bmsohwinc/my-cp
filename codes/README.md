```

codes from various sites as and when I solve them.

## Rules: 
1. File name format for easy reference in the future:
    - <site-code>-<problem-id>-<difficulty-code>-<tag-codes>.<file-ext>
2. First few lines of each file should include 
    - the problem link 
    - the solution link
    - the time taken to solve the problem
    - idea behind solving the problem
