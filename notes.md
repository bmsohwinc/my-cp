## Common findings in the process
1. Should evaluate all **corner cases** effectively.
    - They will hold clue in easy type problems
    - Maybe even in harder problems.
    - check: link1
2. Handling **decimal precisions** with a fraction
    - Sometimes using decimals is hard -- leads to lot of precision errors
    - Instead, use numerator-denominator approach
    - And solve equations accordingly
    - This way, we can solve problems much easily, specially when there are time constraints and Python can't be used
    - check: link2
3. Sometimes **brute-force** can also work, try it once.
    - There won't be any way of optimizing time
    - Memory optimization could be a possibility
    - They can include simple 2 loops, or sometimes even ONE-PASS with a track of max/min variables
    - check: link3
4. **Two pointer**, **slow pointers** are gems in linked lists and arrays
    - Very easily, with O(1) memory and O(n) time we can solve the questions
    - But needs a bit of thought while fitting in the method
