## Common findings in the process
1. Should evaluate all corner cases effectively.
    - They will hold clue in easy type problems
    - Maybe even in harder problems.

2. Handling decimal precisions with a fraction
    - Sometimes using decimals is hard -- leads to lot of precision errors
    - Instead, use numerator-denominator approach
    - And solve equations accordingly
    - This way, we can solve problems much easily, specially when there are time constraints and Python can't be used
