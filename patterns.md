# Common patterns
- Will explore the patterns of problems across platforms and the king of algorithms/data structures to be used then

### Patterns
- Miss
    - Integer overflow in corner cases
- Hit
    - Think big. Don't overthink. It's always solveable, we just need think of a nice little solution
