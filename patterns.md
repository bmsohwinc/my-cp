### Patterns
- Miss
    - Integer overflow in corner cases
- Hit
    - Think big. Don't overthink. It's always solveable, we just need think of a nice little solution
    - `Sorting` helps in cases where you want to `greedily` optimize some parameter
    - Never ignore something that you don't understand. **_Errors literally say that something is wrong, and you've got to catch and correct it_**
